/*!
A simple chart components library for Dioxus

This crate provides some basic SVG-based chart components, customizable with
CSS, to be used with the [Dioxus] GUI library. The components configuration
was designed to be similar to what one would find in JavaScript chart libraries.

The components available are:

- [PieChart](crate::charts::PieChart): for Pie, Donut and Gauge charts
- [BarChart](crate::charts::BarChart): for Bar and Stacked Bar charts, vertical
or horizontal
- [LineChart](crate::charts::LineChart)

# Usage
This crate is [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/dioxus-charts) and can be
used by adding `dioxus-charts` to your dependencies in your project's `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
dioxus-charts = "0.1.3"
```
